is based on the concept of modular synthesis, which was 
introduced by the firsts audio synthetisers.<br>
<FONT size="-1" color="#666666">
In these, the only signal was coded by voltage in electric wires
which connected signal (sound) processing <B>patches</B> together.<br>
</FONT>
<br>
We kept the concept of patch and extended it far beyond sound and
electric signal processing.<br>
<FONT size="-1" color="#666666">
In Patchwork13!, you can generate and use any kind of data by connecting
patches together, just like you would with a modular synth, but in addition
of sound you can handle everything from text to numbers, images, 3D,
nervous signals, functions... !<br>

Patches let you interact with the data at very low latency.<br>
<FONT size="-1" color="#666666">
For instance you could have a <i>joystick</i> patch with two outputs (the 
x and y of your joystick) connected to two different patch inputs and
moving your joystick would directly affect the two connected patches.<br>

<br>
Moreover you can connect and disconnect patches while they are running.<br>
