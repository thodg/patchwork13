I have successfully compiled pw13 and pw13_std under Win32
with MinGW and MSYS.<br><br>
The pw13_demo was added to the CVS. It is a small example program
aimed to test and demonstrate the capabilities of pw13 and pw13_std.<br>
(pw13_demo pumped the first patch ever !)<br>

Work on the GTK+ interface has started, thanks to Vivien and Maxime
who joined the development team.<br>
We'll definitely be using libglade as it will spare us the time to
write a whole lotta more patches.<br>
<br>
The core (pw13) is now in debugging phase and it actually pumped
patches a few days ago !<br>
These are the first tests on 200kb of sources I wrote without any
testing (apart from compiling) so I quite expect some errors...<br>
<br>
I hope next year my holidays will look like holidays : I've never
worked so much.. I hardly have time for myself and Pw13!.<br>

Sorry, I was very busy for these last 3 weeks and I still am but
I'll try to release the alpha anyway...<br>
<br>
During this time I've learnt GTK and I think it would really make
the interface short and sweet to write.<br>
Anyone interested should check <a href="http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/">this page</a>, and if you would like some info to start the GUI , or think another library would be nicer, please let me know !<br>

Good news : pw13 alpha should be ready within a week !<br>
The polymorphic operators won't make it for this release.<br>
I'm working on the STD lib, dynamic loading of patches should be fine
with only one patch class per dynamic library file.
These have the extension <b>.pw13p</b>
<br>
I'm not quite sure about installation paths with automake,
if someone could help me it would be great !<br>
(I've stopped dreaming about help, but I'll try anyway =)
