EPITA school year is over</H3>
The EPITA project is over but Patchwork13! goes on. We got 18/20 for our final presentation, hard work pays !<br />
The few people reading these news may have noticed that RC 0.1 is delayed, this is due to a few bugs but.. hey we're on vacation, give us some time ;)<br />
<br />
I can't wait to use Pw13! to make music. I am starting some tracking patches as I miss them most. Any help in building/porting synths would be utterly sweet.<br />

Subversion !</H3>
We moved from CVS to Subversion today.<br />
DO NOT USE CVS ANYMORE, USE SUBVERSION !<br />
<br />
You can <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/patchwork13/">browse the repository</a> online.<br />
<br />
You will only need to checkout once with<br />
<pre> svn checkout https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/patchwork13/</pre><br />
After that, the usual work cycle is to :<br />
<br />
update your local copy with <pre> svn update</pre><br />
modify sources<br />
<br />
add files with <pre> svn add file1 file2 ...</pre><br />
remove files with <pre> svn rm file1 file2 ...</pre><br />
copy file with <pre> svn cp src dest</pre><br />
move file with <pre> svn mv src dest</pre><br />
check the files status with <pre> svn status</pre><br />
if there are conflicts, either someone fixed them and you must <pre> svn update</pre><br />
or if you fixed them you must do<br />
<pre> svn resolved file1 file2 ... </pre><br />
finally, commit your changes using <pre> svn commit</pre><br />
Voila !<br />
<br />
Please only commit your changes when everything COMPILES (and works if you're only upgrading stuff).<br />

You can download the win32 installer and test it (see the download section), but beware that it is only an alpha version and that it is still far from being finished.<br />
