  <title>The graphical user interface : pw13_gtk</title>
  <sect1 id="pw13-gtk-overview"><title>Overview</title>
    <para>In this chapter we will explain how to use
      <command>pw13_gtk</command>, our GTK+ graphical user interface.</para>
    <para>It is a very user-friendly interface, which can be
      used even if you cannot type (doh !) because everything
      can be done with the mouse. It allows one to graphically
      create a patchwork and edit it. You can also save it,
      and load a previously created patchwork.</para>

  <sect1><title>The toolbox</title>
    <para>The main window which is the only one when you load
      <command>pw13_gtk</command> is the toolbox
      containing all the patch classes that you can use in a patchwork,
      and a menu wich contains the following.
      You can create a new patchwork from the menu
      <command>File / New</command>.
    </para>
  	<para>You can add a patch to a patchwork by dragging
  	  it from the toolbox tree to the patchwork window.
  	</para>

  <sect1><title>The patchwork window</title>
    <para>In the patchwork window you can move a patch by dragging
      it with the mouse on its name.</para>
    <para>To connect the output of a patch to the input of an other patch
      simply do a drag and drop from the output's check box to the
      input's checkbox. A beautiful line should appear between the output
      and the input. If the connection was not made it probably is because
      the output and the input do not have the same type. You can only connect
      an output to an input if they have the same type. What would happen
      if you multiply text data with 3D points ?</para>
    <para>An important thing in Patchwork13! is that YOU must create a patch
      to make the time move. If you have no patch to make the time move you
      can use the patch /std/time/augend, which just constantly increase
      the time between each pump.</para>
    <para>When you have created patches and connected them together,
      you are ready to start the patchwork by clicking the play button
      at the bottom of the window.</para>
