We started the gui and a linux install party with a lan at
my home (France, Sceaux).
Vivien (aka igor aka dubvif aka igorvonfassen aka ... et j'en passe) is emerging firefox, emacs and gnome-games (-_-);
Maxime (babounours) is learning GTK !
And I write crap in this file after having set up autoconf/automake for the project.
As you can see we are almost done and everything should be finished in a thousand years or so (We'll Call You Back (TM))!

max:
GTK seems wonderful to create game on plays-station ,patchwork would be fantastique on it with a play-mouse and a play-keyboard
